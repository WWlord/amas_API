# amas_API
This project belongs to open source software and can be used on the basis of the AFL 3.0 license. In addition to the project presented here, AMAS requires a database for MS SQL. Therefore, I will never tell anyone those ideas that I have not yet implemented in this project. I'd rather let the secret of heather honey die with it than a bunch of ignorant people exploit my ideas as they see fit. I have no doubt that the result of their exploitation of my ideas will be sad both for them and for the deceived users of this system. To properly operate the system, you need to communicate with the author, and not with his "followers". Why did I publish this project? Because it has been stolen and tried to be exploited so many times with various sad results, since I have never told anyone what the idea of this product is. Only I can know what needs to be done so that the product brilliantly solves your problems. Therefore, I am waiting for 1. payment for my work, 2. an audience to which I would transfer my knowledge. If they are worthy of my attention.
